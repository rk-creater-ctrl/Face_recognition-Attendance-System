PROJECT TITLE:
Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV

DESCRIPTION:
This project automatically marks attendance using face recognition.
The system detects and recognizes registered faces through a webcam
and records attendance with date and time in a CSV file.
An audio beep confirms successful attendance marking.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas

FEATURES:
- Real-time face detection
- Face recognition using LBPH algorithm
- Automatic attendance marking
- CSV report generation
- Audio notification on success
- Prevents duplicate attendance

HOW TO RUN:
1. Run capture_faces.py to collect face data
2. Run train_model.py to train the system
3. Run attendance.py to mark attendance

APPLICATIONS:
- Schools and colleges
- Offices
- Labs and classrooms
